=========================
Step 4: Build a Simple Todo Client App using the TDD Approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

In this step, we made a CRUD app by using Sql database *(PostgresDB)*. Data will be stored permanantly to the database



Running the App:
---------------
<br />
  1) To test this app, First run this command *"npm install"*.<br />
  2) After complete this command run *"npm start".*<br />
  3) Start the server<br />
    a)To run the server go to the directory "Part1-BackendServer/Step2-Todo-SqlDB"<br />
    b)Then run the command *"npm install"* and after that run *"npm run nodemon"*







  Code Structure:
  --------------

  a) _Save data to Sql database_<br />
      1) To save data to database, we made a *"POST"* request to server through axios. The server collects data save to PostgresDB table



  b) _Get data from Sql database_<br />
      1) To get data from Sql database we send a *"GET"* request through axios to server. The server finds all the toDos and responed back.


  c) _Update Data on Sql database_<br />
      1) To update data on database, we send the updated data along with unique id for that todo to server by *"PUT"* request through axios.<br />
      2) The server finds ToDo by id on PostgresDB table and update it


  d) _Delete a todo_<br />
      1) To delete a ToDo, we made a *"DELETE"* request through axios along with id of ToDo<br />
      2) Then server finds the ToDo with same id and delete it.
